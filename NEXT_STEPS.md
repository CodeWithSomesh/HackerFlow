# Next Steps - AI Idea Generator Feature

## Immediate Action Required

### 1. Apply Database Migration (5 minutes)

The conversations table and new hackathon fields need to be added to your database.

**Steps:**
1. Open your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query**
5. Open this file: `lib/supabase/migrations/001_add_conversations_and_hackathon_fields.sql`
6. Copy all contents and paste into SQL Editor
7. Click **Run**
8. You should see "Success. No rows returned"

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Run this query to verify
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversations;
-- Should return 0 (table exists but empty)
```

### 2. Test the Features (10 minutes)

#### Test 1: Idea Generation with Details
1. Navigate to `/ai-idea-generator`
2. Select a hackathon
3. Add some inspiration (e.g., "I want to build a web app for tracking carbon footprint")
4. Click "Generate Idea"
5. Wait for the idea to generate (may take 20-30 seconds)
6. **Verify**: You should see detailed sections:
   - Database Recommendation (blue box)
   - Security Best Practices (red box)
   - Deployment Guide (purple box)
   - Winning Strategy (yellow box)

#### Test 2: Resume Upload
1. Go back to input page
2. Upload a text file with some skills listed
3. Generate idea
4. **Verify**: Idea should reference skills from your resume

#### Test 3: Chat Feature
1. After generating an idea, click "Save Idea" button
2. Wait for success toast
3. Scroll to the right chat panel
4. Type a question (e.g., "What database should I use?")
5. Press Enter or click Send
6. **Verify**: AI responds with detailed answer
7. Check Supabase dashboard ‚Üí `conversations` table
8. **Verify**: Your messages are saved

### 3. Optional: Test Validation (5 minutes)

If you have a hackathon with specific requirements:

1. Go to Supabase dashboard ‚Üí `hackathons` table
2. Find your hackathon
3. Edit the `requirements` field, add something like:
   ```
   This hackathon only accepts web applications. No mobile apps allowed.
   ```
4. Save the changes
5. Go back to AI Idea Generator
6. Select that hackathon
7. In inspiration, write: "I want to build a mobile app for iOS"
8. Generate idea
9. **Expected**: AI should return an error saying mobile apps aren't allowed

## What's Working Now

‚úÖ **Resume Upload**: Properly analyzes user skills
‚úÖ **Hackathon Validation**: Checks against rules and requirements
‚úÖ **Detailed Results**: Shows database, security, deployment info
‚úÖ **Chat with AI**: Saves conversations to database
‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Conversations table created
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Professional error messages

## Known Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Resume Format**: Only works with plain text files (.txt). PDF parsing not implemented yet.
‚ö†Ô∏è **Chat Activation**: Must save idea before chatting (by design for data integrity).
‚ö†Ô∏è **Response Time**: Idea generation takes 20-30 seconds (normal for detailed output).

## If Something Doesn't Work

### Chat Not Working
- **Check**: Did you save the idea first?
- **Check**: Is there a conversation ID in the console logs?
- **Fix**: Click "Save Idea" button, wait for toast, then try chatting

### No Detailed Sections Showing
- **Check**: Look in browser console for any errors
- **Check**: Did the AI return JSON?
- **Fix**: Try regenerating the idea

### Database Migration Failed
- **Error**: "relation already exists"
  - **Fix**: This is okay! It means the table already exists
- **Error**: "permission denied"
  - **Fix**: Make sure you're logged in as the project owner
- **Error**: "function does not exist"
  - **Fix**: Run the main schema.sql file first

### Resume Not Being Analyzed
- **Check**: Is the file size under 10MB?
- **Check**: Is it a .txt file?
- **Check**: Look in console for "resumeText" value
- **Fix**: Try a plain text file with skills clearly listed

## File Reference

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Check the terminal where Next.js is running
3. Check Supabase logs (Dashboard ‚Üí Logs)
4. Review `AI_IDEA_GENERATOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed explanations

## What's Next?

After verifying everything works, you might want to:

1. **Add PDF Resume Parsing**: Use a library like `pdf-parse`
2. **Create Ideas History Page**: Show all saved ideas
3. **Add Export Feature**: Export ideas as PDF
4. **Improve Validation**: Add more specific rule checks
5. **Team Features**: Share ideas with teammates

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Check if Supabase is connected
# (Should not show any connection errors in console)

# Test the API endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/generate-idea \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"test"}],"hackathonTitle":"Test"}'
```
