# HackerFlow - Changes Summary

## Overview
This document outlines all the fixes and enhancements made to the HackerFlow application to resolve bugs and add new features.

---

## 1. Fixed Database Constraint Issue - 'hackathons_mode_check' ✅

### Problem
When creating a hackathon in step1 and selecting "Hybrid" mode, users received an error:
```
new row for relation "hackathons" violates check constraint "hackathons_mode_check"
```

### Root Cause
The database schema only allowed `('online', 'offline')` modes, but the application UI and validation schemas supported `'hybrid'` mode as well.

### Solution
1. **Updated Database Schema** (`lib/supabase/schema.sql`):
   - Changed line 296 from: `CHECK (mode IN ('online', 'offline'))`
   - To: `CHECK (mode IN ('online', 'offline', 'hybrid'))`

2. **Created Migration Script** (`lib/supabase/migrations/add_hybrid_mode.sql`):
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE hackathons DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS hackathons_mode_check;
   ALTER TABLE hackathons ADD CONSTRAINT hackathons_mode_check
     CHECK (mode IN ('online', 'offline', 'hybrid'));
   ```

### Action Required
**You must run this migration on your Supabase database:**

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `lib/supabase/migrations/add_hybrid_mode.sql`
3. Click "Run" to execute the migration
4. Verify the constraint was updated successfully

## 2. Enhanced Prize Handling - Certificate Prizes ✅

### Problem
The system required an amount for all prize types, including certificates, which don't have a monetary value.

### Solution

#### 2.1 Updated Validation Schema (`lib/validations/createHackathons.ts`)
- Changed prize amount from required to optional
- Added custom validation to ensure non-certificate prizes have amounts
- Certificate prizes can now be created without an amount field

```typescript
prizes: z.array(z.object({
  position: z.string().min(1, 'Prize position is required'),
  amount: z.string().optional(), // Changed from required
  description: z.string().optional(),
  type: z.string().min(1, 'Prize type is required')
})).optional().refine((prizes) => {
  // Validate that non-certificate prizes have an amount
  if (!prizes) return true;
  return prizes.every(prize =>
    prize.type === 'Certificate' || (prize.amount && prize.amount.trim().length > 0)
  );
}, {
  message: 'Cash prizes must have an amount specified'
}),
```

#### 2.2 Updated UI (`app/organize/step3/page.tsx`)
- Prize type selector now appears first
- Amount input field is conditionally hidden when "Certificate" is selected
- Updated validation logic to allow certificate prizes without amounts
- Added user-friendly error messages

### Features
- ✅ Certificate prizes don't require an amount
- ✅ Cash and Other prizes still require amounts
- ✅ Dynamic UI that adapts based on prize type selection
- ✅ Clear validation messages for users

   - States that organizers can be held legally accountable
   - Acknowledges HackerFlow is not liable for event issues

4. **Security & Privacy**

## Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- The current payment implementation is a **UI mockup**
- You need to integrate with a real payment gateway:
  - Stripe (recommended)
  - Razorpay (for India)
  - PayPal
  - Square
- Never process real payments without proper PCI compliance
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper server-side payment validation

### Document Storage
- The verification documents upload is currently simulated
- You need to implement actual upload to Supabase Storage:
  1. Create a bucket for organizer documents
  2. Set up RLS policies for document access
  3. Update the modal to upload files
  4. Store document URLs in database

### Future Enhancements
- Admin panel to review verification documents
- Email notifications for verification status
- Payment receipt generation
- Refund request system (with admin approval)
- Multiple payment methods support
- Payment history tracking

## Database Schema Additions Needed

Consider adding these columns to the `hackathons` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE hackathons ADD COLUMN verification_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (verification_status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected'));
ALTER TABLE hackathons ADD COLUMN identity_document_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE hackathons ADD COLUMN authorization_letter_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE hackathons ADD COLUMN payment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (payment_status IN ('pending', 'completed', 'failed', 'refunded'));
ALTER TABLE hackathons ADD COLUMN payment_amount DECIMAL(10, 2);
ALTER TABLE hackathons ADD COLUMN payment_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE hackathons ADD COLUMN payment_transaction_id TEXT;
```

---

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs for database errors
3. Ensure all migrations have been run
4. Verify all environment variables are set
5. Check that all component imports are correct

For questions or issues, please refer to the original task requirements or create a new issue.
