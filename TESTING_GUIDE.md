# Testing Guide for Team Invitation & Registration System

## ‚úÖ All Issues Fixed!

### Issue 1 & 2: Email Sending (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Resend's `onboarding@resend.dev` can only send to your own email address.

**Solution**: Implemented development mode that simulates email sending.

**How it works now**:
- In **development** (`npm run dev`): Emails are simulated, details logged to console
- In **production** (`npm run build`): Real emails sent via Resend

**What you'll see**:
```
When you add a member or send invite via email:
‚úÖ Success toast: "Invitation link created! (Dev mode: check console for email details)"
üìß Server console shows full email details
```

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode (Current)
```bash
npm run dev
```
- ‚úÖ Emails are simulated (logged to console)
- ‚úÖ Works without domain verification
- ‚úÖ Can test with any email address
- ‚úÖ No actual emails sent

### Production Mode (Future)
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires verified domain on Resend
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Or use `onboarding@resend.dev` (only sends to your email)
- ‚úÖ Real emails sent to recipients

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "You were not invited to this team"
**Cause**: User's email doesn't match any team member record
**Solution**: Team leader must first add the member via "Add Member" button

### Issue: "You are already registered with a different team"
**Cause**: User is in another team for the same hackathon
**Solution**: User must cancel their current registration first

### Issue: Email not receiving (in production)
**Cause**: Using `onboarding@resend.dev` without domain
**Solution**: See [RESEND_DOMAIN_SETUP.md](./RESEND_DOMAIN_SETUP.md) for domain setup

### Issue: Copy link not working
**Cause**: Browser clipboard permissions
**Solution**: Make sure localhost or HTTPS is used

**IMPORTANT**: Before testing, run this SQL in Supabase:

File: `add-delete-policy.sql`

This adds RLS policies for:
- Deleting team members
- Deleting teams
- Deleting registrations
- Updating member details
